# abc.xyz_web
//charity website based on my previous web project; all programmed by david s
#
The majority of the project is pulled from my current at-home web project. The rest of the project is uniquely coded by me and sources scripting from W3 and a variety of other websites. The website also boasts a functioning email service which is responsible for feedback and inquiries. The project was created for my health class and also features an interconnected series of accounts associated with the site. The majority of scripting is backend while the frontend scripting is visible within the site's footer, and landing pad.

To access the email features you must click the email icon at the footer of the page.

Functionality:

//
The majority of functionality is located within the footer,
to access the footer the user must scroll to the bottom of the page and click any of the links present with the footer.

The first link is the instagram page of the association

The second link redirects the user to the association's twitter

The third link leads to the email page of the site, here the user can create enquiries and submit feedback to the developer.
